        - qs-inventory: Using money as an item (not supported by qb-core by default) may cause issues we can't resolve, as it's handled internally. When money is used as an item, it isn't included in getInventoryItems.
        - qb-inventory: Money as an item isn't supported by default. If you need item-based money, we recommend using ox_inventory, which handles it correctly.
        - tgiann-inventory:
            Money as an item is not supported by default.
            When clearing inventory, we now use the ClearInventory export to directly remove the item.
            If money is not being removed properly, we can’t fix it, as it’s handled internally.

        =========================================================

        How to test if the dispatch is working:

        1. Make sure you are in-game.
        2. Open your txAdmin panel and go to "Live Console".
        3. Type: rcore_prison_test_dispatch
        4. Press Enter.
        5. You should receive a test dispatch in-game.

        If you don't see the dispatch, check that:
        * The dispatch resource is started.
        * You are in job named police
        * Make sure that supported dispatch is run before rcore_prison.
        * No errors are showing in the server console.
