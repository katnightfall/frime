Hello, thank you for buying my script. 

To setup add to your server and start it.
if you see "you lack the permission etc" you need to restart the server and ensure its on the correct key 


To setup perms add in:

add_ace group.whataver pdcomserv allow

Or if you want to separate what perms do what look in the server config of my script and play with the permission and change on your server.cfg lastly make a ticket in discord.gg/developing if you need help.
