# wt_grafitti

First of all thanks for purchasing the script 💖

## Setup

Setting up for usage with a custom framework (ESX, QB, ANY)

We provide a default integration with these framework out of the box
    - ESX
    - QB 

All you have to do is change the file `fxmanifest_frameworkname.lua` to `fxmanifest.lua` and you're ready to go!
If you don't find your framework of choice here, your either on your own or [ask me](#need-any-more-help-contact) and ill be glad to help you!

## Issues

### Script fails on drawing animation

The animation for drawing requires an higher GTAV build that your server uses, you can change the drawing animation in the [config file](config.lua) or just bump up your server GTAV version build

### Grafitti failed to upload to server / Ratelimit

You're probably using the default API key, [registering your own personal key](https://api.imgbb.com/) will be more than enough to overcome that issue.
If you're still hitting the ratelimit you'll need to change the service or host the images locally
