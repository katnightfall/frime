!!! NOTE !!!

We have no replacement for the LOD file that you will delete from Gabz's resource, so you will end up with no having any LODs regarding the restaurant 
(so you will not be able to see any changes from some distance). This is not our fault and we cannot do anything with it, we tried to contact Gabz, but
the response was, that he doesn't cooperate with another creators completely and as the LOD file is locked via Tebex, he will not send us unlocked this
LOD file.
