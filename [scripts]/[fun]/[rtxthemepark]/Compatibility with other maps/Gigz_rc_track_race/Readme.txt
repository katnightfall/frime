1) Open gigz_rc_track_race [stream] folder and delete : 
- hei_sm_rd_long_1.ymap
- hei_sm_rd_strm_0.ymap
- hei_sm_rd_strm_3.ymap
- hei_sm_occl_02.ymap (as I think this file is not neccesary at all there)
( After that it's finish for edit gigz files )

2) Open RTX [ GTA_ymap] folder ( rtx_themepark_objects\stream\GTA_ymaps ) and delete : 
- hei_sm_rd_long_1.ymap

AND replace it with the new from this folder:

- hei_sm_rd_strm_0.ymap
- hei_sm_rd_strm_3.ymap

4) reboot your server.it's finish.
